## Project Summary:
The Diabetes Risk Predictor project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the risk of developing diabetes based on various factors, including health habits, health indicators, demographics, and comorbid conditions. By analyzing these factors, the model will provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and individuals to identify at-risk populations and implement preventive measures, ultimately improving diabetes prevention, early detection, and management.
### Objectives:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:** 
    - Gather a diverse dataset encompassing health habits, health indicators, demographic information, and comorbid conditions. 
    - Clean, preprocess, and explore the data to identify potential patterns and correlations.
2. **Model Development:** 
    - Select and implement suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to create a predictive model.
3. **Model Evaluation:** 
    - Assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and refine it as needed.
