## Project Summary:
The Diabetes Risk Predictor project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the risk of developing diabetes based on various factors, including symptoms, health habits, demographics, and other medical conditions. By analyzing these factors, the model will provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and individuals to identify at-risk populations and implement preventive measures, ultimately improving diabetes prevention, early detection, and management.
### Objectives:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:** 
    - Gather a diverse dataset encompassing symptoms, health habits, demographics, and other medical conditions. 
    - Clean, preprocess, and explore the data to identify potential patterns and correlations.
2. **Model Development:** 
    - Select and implement suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to create a predictive model.
3. **Model Evaluation:** 
    - Assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and refine it as needed.
4. **Visualize the Dataset:**
    - Visualizing the dataset helps provide an overview of the dataset such as number of participants, gender mix, race mix, and other key factors.
5. **Demonstration of the Neural Network Model:**
    - Import the saved model file to demonstrate the ease of replicating the neural network model for future datasets.
